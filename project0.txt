a. My experience installing Nachos was fairly simple. Through a vscode extension (Remote SSH), 
   I was able to connect to my wolf.cs.fiu.edu virtual machine. Using a wget command, I downloaded the nachos-3.4 zip, 
   which I then unzipped and proceeded to compile nachos. 

b. The tests performed as expected. I used the TA's instructional video as a visual guide to ensure that the single step test 
   produced the expected outcomes, which it did as it hung after 22 ticks and executed one step at a time. 
   The first test also ran as expected, as it also hung after 22 ticks.

c. The purpose of the Threads class is to handle the thread objects and their lifecycle. Within the threads folder, there is 
   thread.h which declares the threads class, thread.cc is the implementation, and the switch files handle the switching 
   between threads. Focusing on the thread.cc file, there are four methods that contribute to thread management. These are
   Fork, Finish, Yield, and Sleep. When called, the Fork method creates a new thread to execute a procedure. Finish cleans
   up once a thread finishes its task. Yield allows for CPU to focus on a different thread that is ready to run. Finally, Sleep
   blocks the thread and removes it from the ready queue. These methods, along with the rest of the Threads class is vital for 
   Nachos to run effectively.
